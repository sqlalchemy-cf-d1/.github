# CSCD01 Project – Cloudflare D1 Integration with Apache Superset

Welcome to the **CSCD01 Project** organization! This organization hosts all repositories related to integrating **Cloudflare D1** databases with **Apache Superset**, including the custom DBAPI driver, SQLAlchemy dialect, and Superset engine specifications.

---

## Repositories

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `dbapi-d1` | **Retired.** Cloudflare D1 DBAPI 2.0 driver implementation, used by `sqlalchemy-d1` 0.1.0. Replaced by the driver built into [sqlalchemy-cloudflare-d1](https://github.com/CollierKing/sqlalchemy-cloudflare-d1). |
| `sqlalchemy-d1` | SQLAlchemy dialect for D1. Provides SQLAlchemy compatibility, reflection, and column type mapping. Since 0.2.0 it builds on [sqlalchemy-cloudflare-d1](https://github.com/CollierKing/sqlalchemy-cloudflare-d1) and supports SQLAlchemy 2.0. |
| `superset-engine-d1` | **Retired.** Superset EngineSpec for D1. Superset 6.1.0 and newer ship their own D1 engine spec. |
| `client` | Temporary test client for verifying DBAPI and engine functionality. |

## Project Structure

```
d01-project/
├── dbapi-d1/
├── sqlalchemy-d1/
├── superset-engine-d1/
└── client/
```

Each repository is independent, uses **Poetry** for dependency management, and contains its own virtual environment.

## Project Setup

Setup instructions can be found in [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md).

## Development Notes

* The `D1Dialect` in `sqlalchemy-d1` handles schema reflection and type mapping for D1.
* Superset ships the D1 engine spec itself, in `superset/db_engine_specs/d1.py`. `superset-engine-d1` is retired.
* Since `sqlalchemy-d1` 0.2.0, DBAPI operations come from `sqlalchemy-cloudflare-d1`. `dbapi-d1` is retired. Always use **parameterized queries** to avoid injection issues.
